## Overview

The Dashboard component serves as the main interface for WWE Universe Manager. It provides a centralized location for accessing all major features through a show selector dropdown and action buttons.

## Component Structure

The dashboard is organized into several key sections:

### Show Selector Section
- **Dropdown**: Displays all available shows from the database
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner while fetching shows
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if show loading fails
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes when new shows are created

### Action Buttons Section
A grid of buttons providing access to main application features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Create Show"
    icon="plus"
  >
    Navigate to the show creation form
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Wrestlers"
    icon="users"
  >
    Open wrestler details in a separate window
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Championships"
    icon="trophy"
  >
    Access championship management (planned feature)
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Test Data"
    icon="database"
  >
    Populate database with sample wrestlers and shows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical Implementation

### Component Definition

```rust
#[component]
pub fn Dashboard() -> impl IntoView {
    // Signal for managing show selection
    let (selected_show, set_selected_show) = signal(None::<Show>);
    
    // Resource for loading shows from database
    let shows_resource = Resource::new(|| (), |_| get_shows());
    
    view! {
        // Dashboard layout with show selector and action buttons
    }
}
```

### State Management

The dashboard uses Leptos signals for reactive state management:

- **`selected_show`**: Tracks the currently selected show from the dropdown
- **`shows_resource`**: Manages the asynchronous loading of shows from the database

### Styling

The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS with WWE theming:

```rust
view! {
    <div class="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 to-slate-800 text-white p-6">
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            // Show selector and action buttons
        </div>
    </div>
}
```

                Ok(_) => {
                    // Trigger shows reload
                    shows_resource.refetch();
                }
                Err(e) => {
                    // Handle error
                }
            }
        });
    }
    ```
    Populates database with sample data and refreshes the show dropdown.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Responsive Design

The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes:

### Desktop Layout
- **Grid**: 2x2 grid for action buttons
- **Spacing**: Generous padding and margins
- **Typography**: Large headings and readable text

### Mobile Layout
- **Stack**: Vertical stacking of elements
- **Buttons**: Full-width action buttons
- **Dropdown**: Full-width show selector

### CSS Implementation

```css
/* Action buttons grid */
.grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 1.5rem;
}

/* Mobile adjustments */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
