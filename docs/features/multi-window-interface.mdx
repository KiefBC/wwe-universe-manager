## Workflow Integration

### Dashboard-Centric Design

The main dashboard serves as the central hub:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main Dashboard] --> B[Wrestler Lists]
    A --> C[Championship Lists]
    A --> D[Show Management]
    
    B --> E[Wrestler Details Window]
    C --> F[Title Details Window]
    D --> G[Booker Dashboard]
    
    E --> H[Power Ratings Editor]
    E --> I[Championship Tracker]
    F --> J[Holder Management]
    F --> K[Title History]
```

### Simultaneous Multi-Window Usage

Users can efficiently manage their wrestling universe with multiple windows:

1. **Main Dashboard**: Select current show and access management tools
2. **Wrestler Window**: Edit wrestler profiles and power ratings
3. **Title Window**: Manage championship holders and history
4. **Booker Dashboard**: Book matches with show-specific rosters

### Cross-Window Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MD as Main Dashboard
    participant WW as Wrestler Window
    participant TW as Title Window
    participant DB as Database
    
    MD->>WW: Open wrestler details
    WW->>DB: Fetch wrestler data
    DB-->>WW: Return wrestler info
    WW->>DB: Update power ratings
    DB-->>TW: Notify title changes
    TW->>TW: Refresh champion info
```

## Technical Implementation

### URL-Based State Management

Each window maintains its state through sophisticated URL routing:

```typescript
// Window state preservation
const wrestlerWindow = {
  url: "index.html#wrestler?id=1",
  label: "wrestler-details",
  title: "Wrestler Details"
}

const titleWindow = {
  url: "index.html#title?id=1", 
  label: "title-details",
  title: "Title Details"
}
```

### Single Instance Architecture

The system prevents window proliferation through intelligent window management:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Window Creation">
    ```rust
    #[tauri::command]
    async fn open_wrestler_window(app: AppHandle, wrestler_id: Option<String>) -> Result<(), String> {
        let window_label = "wrestler-details";
        
        // Check if window already exists
        if let Some(existing) = app.get_webview_window(window_label) {
            existing.set_focus()?;
            return Ok(());
        }
        
        // Create new window
        let url = format!("index.html#wrestler?id={}", wrestler_id.unwrap_or_default());
        tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::new(&app, window_label, tauri::WebviewUrl::App(url.into()))
            .title("Wrestler Details")
            .inner_size(885.0, 860.0)
            .build()?;
            
        Ok(())
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="State Detection">
    ```rust
    // Frontend component routing
    let is_wrestler_window = use_memo(move |_| {
        web_sys::window()
            .unwrap()
            .location()
            .hash()
            .unwrap_or_default()
            .contains("#wrestler")
    });
    
    let wrestler_id = use_memo(move |_| {
        extract_id_from_url()
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Real-Time Synchronization

Changes are synchronized across all windows through reactive state management:

```rust
// Leptos reactive signals ensure real-time updates
let (wrestler, set_wrestler) = create_signal(None::<Wrestler>);

// Update propagates to all components using this wrestler
Effect::new(move |_| {
    if let Some(w) = wrestler.get() {
        // All windows displaying this wrestler will update
        log::info!("Wrestler updated: {}", w.name);
    }
});
```
